## Libraries

* [AbendInfo](https://github.com/mhightower83/AbendInfo) Arduino ESP8266 library - Improve Postmortem reporting by intercepting some crash events that result in Hardware or Software WDT Resets. And, cache the results across reboot.

* [BacktraceLog](https://github.com/mhightower83/BacktraceLog) An Arduino ESP8266 library that generates and stores a backtrace of a crash in an IRAM or DRAM log buffer. By crunching the stack trace and code to create a list of function addresses at play when the crash occurred, we can condense the amount of data that needs to be stored for later analysis. Reducing the data to a small list allows storage in slivers of unused IRAM or noinit DRAM, which can optionally be backed up to User RTC memory.
* [MAX31855K](https://github.com/mhightower83/MAX31855K) Arduino ESP8266 Device Library for the MAX31855K with the option to apply linear corrections to non-linear thermocouple response.
   * The [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/mhightower83/MAX31855K/wiki/Troubleshooting#troubleshooting) section has some insight into issues that can occur with the ESP8266 and SPI devices.
* [SpiFlashUtils](https://github.com/mhightower83/SpiFlashUtils) An Arduino ESP8266 library that supports reclaiming the use of GPIO pins 9 and 10 on ESP8266 modules that expose access to those pins. SPI Flash Mode "DIO" or "DOUT" is required.
   * [A Review of Past Attempts](https://github.com/mhightower83/Arduino-ESP8266-misc/wiki/Pins-GPIO9-and-GPIO10#a-review-of-past-attempts)
* [JedecJep106Lib](https://github.com/mhightower83/JedecJep106Lib) SPI Flash Bank/MFG ID Lookup. Provides a wrapper to use flash manufacturer name look-up library from [tianocore/edk2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdePkg/Library/JedecJep106Lib/JedecJep106Lib.c) on an Arduino build platform.

## Tools
* [WiFiPcap](https://github.com/mhightower83/WiFiPcap) This project streams PCAP-encapsulated packets to Wireshark gathered from the ESP32-S3's WiFi Promiscuous interface. A Python script on the host side manages communication and setup with the ESP32-S3 while streaming packets from the USB interface to Wireshark.
